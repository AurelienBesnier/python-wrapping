# Wrapping

All the wrapping methods used in this intercomparison is done "out of the box" i.e. no size optimizations or whatever.

Meaning that the wrappers can be improved with size optimization lto and so on.

This test is meant to showcase the best wrapping methods with as little effort as possible configuration wise.
